I always had an question how the Personal Access Token works and how it's generated and managed. In this blog i will cover how to create your own PAT (Personal Access Token) system.

For years, logging in to things online relied on usernames and passwords. But sometimes password can be a pain! They're easy to forget, and even harder to keep truly secure.

This is where Personal Access Tokens (PAT's) come in. They're a new way to log in to apps and services, and they offer some big advantages over passwords.

Here's why passwords can be frustrating:

- Leaky: Hackers can steal passwords in all sorts of ways, leaving your accounts vulnerable.
- Forgettable: Who remembers dozens of complex passwords? We all reuse passwords, which is a security risk.
- Inflexible: Passwords are all-or-nothing. You either have access or you don't.

PATs aim to solve these problems by offering a more secure and flexible way to log in.

## What is PATs?

Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are long string of random characters that act as digital credentials, enabling secure access to resources without the need for password. These tokens are generated and managed by user, granting them granular control over the scope of access granted to each PAT.

PAT offer several distinct advantages over traditional passwords:

- Enhanced Security: PATs can be granted specific permissions, limiting the potential damage if compromised.
- Flexibility: PATs can be tailored to specific tasks or applications, enabling precise control over access privileges.
- Third-party Integration: PAT facilitate secure integration with third-party tools and applications, eliminating the need to share passwords.

PATs are characterized by several key features:

- Unique Generation: Each PAT is a unique string of characters, preventing unauthorized access.
- Granular Permission: PATs can be granted specific permissions, limiting their scope of access.
- Revocability: PATs can be revoked at any time, effectively disabling them in case of compromise.
