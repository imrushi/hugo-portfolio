## Begin

This is the new beginning and also my second blog, which is also a non-technical blog ([first blog](https://rushipanchariya.medium.com/how-to-use-face-api-js-for-face-detection-in-video-or-image-using-angular-fca1e4bef797)). I have decided to start writing blogs so that I can share my thoughts and knowledge and improve my writing skills. I will be writing blogs about mostly technical stuff and sometimes non-technical stuff. In technical blogs, I will cover whatever research I have done, and while doing research, I will keep my notes in the [Notes section]({{<ref "notes">}}).

## Plan and Present

As of now, I donâ€™t have a full plan for what I am going to write, which topics I will cover, or where it will go. But I remember a quote that says to `go with the flow and be more concerned with the journey than the destination`.

> "A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving." - Lao Tzu

To start with, I will be writing blogs about [Golang](https://go.dev/), which I am currently obsessed with.

As said, I am currently obsessed with Golang, like how it internally works and all. I will start with its basics, and as I go along with my research, I will dig down into how Golang works internally. I am more curious to do research on its internal workings and its concurrency. I will try to explain all the things in an easy way (I hope so ðŸ˜¬).

As I go with blogs, I will create YouTube videos for the same on my channel. I have lots of project ideas that I will create as an example, and if it is an interesting idea or helpful, I will make it open-source, or you guys can start contributing your ideas to the project.

From my contribution, I have remembered how I struggled with starting to contribute to open-source projects. So definitely, I will write a blog about how to get started with open source. Also,share my experience with it. As of now,I am contributing to [vscode-extension](https://github.com/ory/cli-vscode-extension) for [ORY](https://ory.sh) organization, which mostly provides solutions in the areas of authentication, authorization, access control, and zero-trust networking with their open-source projects. I will create a new tab where I can keep track of the ideas.

So my plan will be, in short:

- Research on the topic
- Add to [Notes]({{<ref "notes">}})
- Write blog
- Make YouTube Videos

## Let Go

Let us begin this journey and learn as we go. The start may not be great, but you have to start to be great.
