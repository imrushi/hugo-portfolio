&lt;p>The theme includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>5 duotone themes&lt;/strong>, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">&lt;strong>Fira Code&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> as default monospaced font. It&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>really nice, custom duotone&lt;/strong> syntax highlighting based on &lt;a href="https://prismjs.com">&lt;strong>PrismJS&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mobile friendly layout&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
